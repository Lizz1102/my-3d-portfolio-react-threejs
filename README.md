## TODOs

- [ ] Test thoroughly before release. Essential features but a smooth, great experience
- [ ] Display Pictures(Important)
- [ ] Add LinkedIn login? Don't add anonymous commenting, we don't want chaos. It's my home, so I'd rather love less comments with authenticity 
- [ ] Refactor for scalability, testability, and maintainability
- [ ] Update the UI design for better accessibility
- [ ] Write unit tests for the user authentication module
- [ ] Add reply to a comment
